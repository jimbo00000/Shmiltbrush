# Shmiltbrush

Shmiltbrush is a clone of some Vive app on Steam, I forget the name. It uses the Vive's controllers to paint using geometry instances in Three.js.

## How to run it

Get the latest [Chromium build](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/) with experimental WebVR support.

Run it with the following command line to enable filesystem access:

```
>chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
```

## Paint in 3D with the Vive Controller

Adjust brush size with the touchpad, press any button to leave geometry behind.

### Save and Load files

Press the 's' key to save. To load, drag the saved json file onto the Chromium window.
